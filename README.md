## Network infrastructure üåê

<img width="1994" alt="Network_Diagram" src="https://github.com/RafieAmandio/ShieldWatchIOT/assets/88525718/c9b84ea3-2396-447d-a7f9-d86fd46fc8e9">

In the architecture of our smart home security and automation system, the integration of software and hardware components is seamlessly achieved through the utilization of the HiveMQ MQTT broker and REST API. Acting as a central communication hub, the MQTT broker facilitates real-time data exchange among IoT devices, including the ESP32 CAM and ESP32 microcontroller, ensuring decentralized yet efficient interactions. On the software side, the REST API serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend, enabling user-centric functionalities such as authentication, registration, and device management. This RESTful architecture ensures standardized and stateless communication, fostering interoperability and user-friendly interactions. The synergy between the MQTT broker and REST API forms a cohesive and responsive system, where devices communicate swiftly, and users have seamless control over their smart home environment. This integrated approach not only enhances reliability and responsiveness but also provides a scalable foundation for future feature enhancements and adaptations to evolving smart home requirements.

## Software Implementation

### Frontend Software üñ•Ô∏è

The frontend system plays a pivotal role, leveraging the power of React to provide an intuitive and dynamic interface for monitoring all devices connected to a user's account. React, known for its efficiency and flexibility, serves as the backbone for creating a responsive and engaging user experience.

#### Primary Functions
The primary function of the frontend is to serve as a centralized hub for monitoring devices. Through React components, users can seamlessly navigate and visualize real-time data from their connected IoT devices. The system employs REST API calls to establish a secure and efficient connection with the backend, facilitating essential functionalities like user authentication, device registration, and management.

#### Communication Protocols
To establish communication with IoT devices, the frontend utilizes MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. MQTT's lightweight and efficient nature makes it an ideal choice for real-time data exchange with IoT devices. This connection enables the frontend to receive and display crucial information from the devices, ensuring users have immediate access to the latest updates and warnings.

#### Reasoning for Using MQTT and REST API
**MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):** We chose MQTT for efficient and real-time communication between the monitoring device and the Frontend. MQTT's lightweight protocol ensures rapid data transfer, making it ideal for monitoring applications where timely updates are crucial. Its publish-subscribe model allows for an organized and responsive data flow.

**REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface):** The Frontend interacts with the backend through REST API endpoints for user-related functionalities, such as login, registration, and device management. REST API provides a standardized and stateless communication approach, enhancing interoperability and simplifying integration. This choice ensures a secure and scalable foundation for managing user accounts and devices.

### Backend Software ‚öôÔ∏è

The backend system, powered by Node.js and Express, serves as the brains orchestrating key functionalities.

#### Node.js and Express
The backend leverages the efficiency and scalability of Node.js in tandem with the expressive and minimalist framework Express. This combination facilitates the creation of robust APIs and efficient handling of HTTP requests, ensuring a seamless communication channel with the frontend.

#### TensorFlow.js for Facial Comparison
The integration of TensorFlow.js elevates the security aspect by enabling facial comparison. The backend employs this machine learning library to analyze faces captured by the system and compare them with entries in the database. This enhances the system's ability to detect intruders and provides an added layer of protection.

The TensorFlow.js-powered facial comparison module allows the backend to discern intruders by matching faces captured by the system with those stored in the database. This process ensures the system's ability to accurately identify and respond to potential security threats. The backend seamlessly connects with the database, establishing a secure link for quick retrieval and comparison of facial data.

### Database Design üóÉÔ∏è

<img width="1152" alt="Database Design" src="https://github.com/RafieAmandio/ShieldWatchIOT/assets/88525718/f1533734-abe5-4474-9a8d-a3e3355f8670">

The project's database relies on MongoDB, a NoSQL solution chosen for its scalability and flexibility. The database comprises two essential collections: User and Device.

#### User Collection
The User collection serves as the repository for user-centric information, encompassing credentials, preferences, and personalized details. MongoDB's flexible schema accommodates evolving user needs, ensuring seamless user authentication, registration, and a personalized experience.

#### Device Collection
The Device collection centralizes information related to connected IoT devices, housing details such as unique identifiers, status, and metadata. MongoDB's document-oriented structure aligns naturally with managing device data, facilitating straightforward queries and updates.
