These features collectively form the core functionalities of the system, providing a robust smart home security and automation solution. Users can seamlessly manage intruder detection, monitor home parameters, and enjoy the convenience of smart home automation.



## Hardware Design and Implementation Details üîß

### Camera Module üì∑

The Camera Module, a crucial component of the smart home security system, integrates the ESP32 CAM and PIR sensor to enable efficient intruder detection and image capture.

#### Components:
- **ESP32 CAM:** Handles image capture and communication with the backend.
- **PIR Sensor:** Detects human presence to trigger intruder detection.

#### Implementation:
1. **PIR Sensor Activation:** Upon detecting motion, the PIR sensor activates the ESP32 CAM.
2. **Image Capture:** The ESP32 CAM captures images of the detected intrusion.
3. **Communication with Backend:** Captured images are securely transmitted to the backend for further analysis.
4. **Alert Notification:** In parallel, the system notifies the user via email and activates physical indicators like a buzzer and LED.

### Monitoring Module üè°
The Monitoring Module focuses on providing users with real-time data regarding their home environment. It incorporates an ESP32 microcontroller, DHT11, LDR sensor, buzzer, and lamp for comprehensive monitoring.

#### Components:
- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** Serves as the central control unit for the Monitoring Module.
- **DHT11 Sensor:** Monitors room temperature for environmental data.
- **LDR Sensor:** Measures ambient light conditions.
- **Buzzer:** Provides audible alerts in response to warning events.
- **Lamp:** Offers controllable lighting based on automation or user preferences.

#### Implementation:
1. **Environmental Data Monitoring:** The ESP32 microcontroller reads data from the DHT11 and LDR sensors to monitor room temperature and ambient light conditions.
2. **Light Control:** The system automates lighting based on predefined conditions or user preferences.
3. **Alerts and Notifications:** The buzzer provides audible alerts for specific events, ensuring users are promptly informed about critical situations.

These hardware design and implementation details highlight the functionalities of the Camera Module and Monitoring Module. Together, they form a robust smart home security and automation system, incorporating intruder detection, image capture, environmental monitoring, and intelligent control of home devices.


## Network infrastructure üåê


In the architecture of our smart home security and automation system, the integration of software and hardware components is seamlessly achieved through the utilization of the HiveMQ MQTT broker and REST API. Acting as a central communication hub, the MQTT broker facilitates real-time data exchange among IoT devices, including the ESP32 CAM and ESP32 microcontroller, ensuring decentralized yet efficient interactions. On the software side, the REST API serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend, enabling user-centric functionalities such as authentication, registration, and device management. This RESTful architecture ensures standardized and stateless communication, fostering interoperability and user-friendly interactions. The synergy between the MQTT broker and REST API forms a cohesive and responsive system, where devices communicate swiftly, and users have seamless control over their smart home environment. This integrated approach not only enhances reliability and responsiveness but also provides a scalable foundation for future feature enhancements and adaptations to evolving smart home requirements.
